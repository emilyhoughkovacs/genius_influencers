VI think I went out to L.A. He flew me out there to work on his mixtape and his album. This is like March or April, sometime around then. When I got to the studio, he had recorded a reference of a song. It was like, \u2018Man I think this could be a really big song, make a beat to it.\u2019 I was in the studio, and he texted me the voice memo, and I kept listening to it, and he was like, \u2018Man, make it with this type of bounce.

VI had recorded some steel drums over it, and that was the beginning. I had like a kick and some claps\u2014this is like same-day everything. It was just forming ideas, me and him. He\u2019s a great writer, and there were a lot of people in the studio. It was just bouncing ideas for the record. It was just a skeleton, and Sean was like, \u2018Shit, let\u2019s get some of Young Chop\u2019s drums on here.\u2019 He threw his 808s and some high-hats on it, and we kind of had a skeleton at that moment.

VI remember for months, I would work on the beat like every other day ever since I left L.A. I went back to school and just kept working on it. He hit me up, was like, \u2018Yo man, add some new stuff to the beat. I was the beat to be bigger, it\u2019s about to be a really big song.\u2019 I just started added more sounds to it, added some keys to it, a bunch of different strings to it, just to give it this more, like, this feel. Like this epic, stadium type feel. I just wanted to give it this type of emotion, and I just added. I would just add stuff to it like every other day. Whenever I had free time, I would just listen to it and want to improve it.

He wants everything to be A1, and that\u2019s dope. I was thinking, \u2018He might find something in this song that might need to be changed.\u2019 I was ready for that. Then he heard it, he was like, \u2018Hell yeah, this shit\u2019s dope. Let\u2019s load this up and get to finishing this track.\u2019 We just added some extra stuff, chopped up some things at the end, and that was it.
