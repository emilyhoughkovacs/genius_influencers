VBorn in 1830 in rural Amherst, Massachusetts, she spent her entire life in the household of her parents, Emily and Edward Dickinson. Her father, a successful lawyer, was active in local affairs and served in the state legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives. Her older brother, Austin, also a lawyer in Amherst, was her lifelong intellectual companion, sharing her interest in literature and music. Lavinia, the youngest of the three children, shared with her sister the curious distinction of never leaving home. It was Lavinia, who once described the roles of the various members of the Dickinson family. Emily, she wrote, \u201chad to think-she was the only one of us who had that to do;\u2026 Father believed; and mother loved; and Austin has Amherst; and I had the family to keep track of.\u201d

VDickinson\u2019s formal schooling was similarly truncated. At age 10, she was enrolled in the \u201cEnglish Course\u201d at Amherst Academy, where for seven years she studied language, literature, politics, natural science, morals, and society. She was also a student for one year, 1847-48, at nearby Mount Holyoke Female Seminary, which have been founded in 1837 as the nation\u2019s first college of higher education for women.

It was also during this period that her life was transformed into the myth of Amherst. Withdrawing more and more, keeping to her room, sometimes even refusing to see visitors who called, she began to dress only in white-a sartorial habit that added to her reputation as an eccentric.

VAs Dickinson began during the 1850s to develop her poetic resources, she came to look upon marriage as a potential threat to her art. \u201cYou and I Have been strangely silent upon this subject, Susie,\u201d she wrote her future sister-in-law in 1853. \u201cHow dull our lives must seem to the bride, and the plighted maiden, whose days are fed with gold, and who gathers pearls every evening; but to the wife, Susie, sometimes the wife forgotten, our lives perhaps seem dearer than all others in the world; you have seen flowers at morning, satisfied with the dew, and those same sweet flowers at noon with their heads bowed in anguish before the mighty sun\u2026they know that the man of noon is mightier than the morning, and their life is henceforth to him. Oh, Susie, it is dangerous\u2026It does so rend me, Susie, the thought of it when it comes, that I tremble lest at sometime I, too, and yielded up.\u201d Moving toward her own creative flowering, Dickinson feared yielding herself up to marriage and \u201cthe man of noon,\u201d just as she feared giving herself up to the power of God.

VThe first of these curious choices of language is \u201cdivine Majority,\u201d in line 3. \u201cThe Soul\u201d of line 1, not merely \u201ca soul\u201d or a person, shuts her door not only to people at large but also to the majority, even those who bear the stamp of divine sanction. Read this way, the poem also indicates the poet\u2019s decision not to join the society of the Elect, this even though \u201can emperor be kneeling\u201d on her doormat. The conduit of grace, an analogy favored in the sermons of Jonathan Edwards, becomes \u201cthe Valves\u201d of the soul\u2019s discrimination.

saVThough she remains \u201cunmoved,\u201d the soul is neither nihilistic nor solipsistic. Even as the capitalized letter implies zero, the soul chooses \u201cOne\u201d then becomes deaf to all entreaties \u201cLike Stone.\u201d To insist that this necessarily indicates preference for a Unitarian rather than a Trinitarian view carries the interpretation to a theological level that the poem\u2019s language will not sustain. Nevertheless, selectivity in all matters, including religion, is something the poet clearly favours.

VOn a complementary level, one notices the carefully crafted description of the woman not at home to any callers, except one or at most a few. Read this way, which merely supplements the other possible alternatives, the poem states the preference to live in a way unlike that of most nineteenth century women, spurning the conventions of social obligation and what society expects, even though an emperor might attempt to persuade her to join the larger group.

VDickinson depicts the rigor and the finality of the soul\u2019s choice. The numerous field (\u201cample nation\u201d) she has to choose among is contrasted with the narrowing of her choice, \u201cone.\u201d Having chosen, the soul closes the \u201cvalves\u201d of her attention. Is the phrase \u201clike stone\u201d relevant here? The stone could represent the soul\u2019s choice, her attention, or the valves. What qualities do we associate with stone\u2013warmth, cold, softness, flexibility, hardness? Is it a coincidence that the poem ends with \u201cstone\u201d or is it appropriate?

VIn every stanza, the first line is longer (has more syllables and feet) than the other three. The second and fourth lines are shorter (have fewer syllables and feet). However, in the last stanza, the second and fourth lines are shorter than in the preceding stanzas; each line has only two syllables. This exceptionally short line calls attention to itself; these lines sound hard, emphatic, and final, an appropriate effect for the idea expressed in these lines.

VA tone of voice has here expanded to fill a poem, a cadence has achieved appropriate content. It is the tension between these two polar impulses of style that gives Emily Dickinson\u2019s poetry from about this time its capacity for irony, ambiguity and unconventional syntax.

An alternative meaning for \u201cmajority\u201d however provides a reading which is more in keeping with the poem\u2019s peremptory opening: \u201cDo not try to introduce other candidates for the soul\u2019s approval once she has come of age as a divine individual!\u201d \u201cPresent\u201d has now become imperative, the rhythm of the line much more forceful. The poet\u2019s ready resort to the ambiguities her lexicon primed her with (a habitual practice) guarantees that while we prefer this second reading we cannot entirely exclude the first, especially when we find that it anticipates the poem\u2019s final image:

V\u201cLike Stone -\u201d suggests the heroic intransigence of the individual act of choice; along with \u201cValves\u201d however it allows the subordinate recognition that petrified or fossilised valves could not be opened even if the decision (and flow of human sympathy) were reversed. In this context the repeated \u201cUnmoved\u201d in stanza two becomes less ritually portentous, taking on the same kind of ambiguity as that in poem 216 (\u201cSafe in their Alabaster Chambers\u201d) \u2013 not only \u201cresolute\u201d but also \u2018incapable of being touched by human feeling\u201d:

VIt was this poetic method that allowed the poet to give structured verbal play to the provincial anti-role without simplifying the internal conflict between the local culture which secured her status and the cosmopolitan culture which belittled it. Karl Mannheim sees as a classic and often repeated cultural situation the one in which the mythology of the dominant caste of a static rural society (doomed to decline) encounters that of a larger more mobile urban stratum: for a member of the older group, he says, \u201ctwo modes of explanation will collide in thinking about every object.\u201d This was Emily Dickinson\u2019s predicament. She escaped from the traumatic social pressures of her marginality into the creative isolation in which she could write her poetry: her practice of the latter on her own terms provided what Berger and Luckmann call a finite province of meaning, an enclave within the paramount reality\u2019 of common experience. But, as Mannheim says,
p796
a(dp797
Vtag
p798
Vbr
p799
saVThe fact that we give names to things which are in flux implies inevitably a certain stabilisation created along the lines of collective activity. The derivation of our meanings emphasises and covers up, in the interest of collective action, the perpetually fluid process underlying all things.

VThe poet\u2019s withdrawal into isolation, his facility within the poetic \u201cenclave\u201d does not mean immunity from social pressures. His language, imagery, syntax have to envisage a collectivity, an audience however small, by which they can be understood. For Emily Dickinson, constructing in what so many of her poems describe as \u201csilence\u201d the fictions which gave order to her experience, there were two overlapping \u201ccollectivities,\u201d that represented by the good society of her locality and that of the genteel literary audience. Each could be summed up in the person of a representative reader. There are a number of extraordinarily alienated poems written in this period of tension which will be discussed later (Chapter 7 (iv)); and it is impossible to decide whether they are written out of damaged or renounced personal relationships, neurotic mental states or the struggle with words itself.

VBorn in 1830 in rural Amherst, Massachusetts, she spent her entire life in the household of her parents, Emily and Edward Dickinson. Her father, a successful lawyer, was active in local affairs and served in the state legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives. Her older brother, Austin, also a lawyer in Amherst, was her lifelong intellectual companion, sharing her interest in literature and music. Lavinia, the youngest of the three children, shared with her sister the curious distinction of never leaving home. It was Lavinia, who once described the roles of the various members of the Dickinson family. Emily, she wrote, \u201chad to think-she was the only one of us who had that to do;\u2026 Father believed; and mother loved; and Austin has Amherst; and I had the family to keep track of.\u201d

VAs a child, Dickinson attended the First Church of Christ, the local Congregational church, but she, alone among her family, never underwent the experience of conversion-the necessary prelude to full membership in this Calvinist sect. By the late 1850s, she had stopped attending church altogether.

VDickinson\u2019s formal schooling was similarly truncated. At age 10, she was enrolled in the \u201cEnglish Course\u201d at Amherst Academy, where for seven years she studied language, literature, politics, natural science, morals, and society. She was also a student for one year, 1847-48, at nearby Mount Holyoke Female Seminary, which have been founded in 1837 as the nation\u2019s first college of higher education for women.

VBetween 1858 and 1862, it was later discovered, she wrote like a person possessed, often producing a poem a day. It was also during this period that her life was transformed into the myth of Amherst. Withdrawing more and more, keeping to her room, sometimes even refusing to see visitors who called, she began to dress only in white-a sartorial habit that added to her reputation as an eccentric.

VAs Dickinson began during the 1850s to develop her poetic resources, she came to look upon marriage as a potential threat to her art. \u201cYou and I Have been strangely silent upon this subject, Susie,\u201d she wrote her future sister-in-law in 1853. \u201cHow dull our lives must seem to the bride, and the plighted maiden, whose days are fed with gold, and who gathers pearls every evening; but to the wife, Susie, sometimes the wife forgotten, our lives perhaps seem dearer than all others in the world; you have seen flowers at morning, satisfied with the dew, and those same sweet flowers at noon with their heads bowed in anguish before the mighty sun\u2026they know that the man of noon is mightier than the morning, and their life is henceforth to him. Oh, Susie, it is dangerous\u2026It does so rend me, Susie, the thought of it when it comes, that I tremble lest at sometime I, too, and yielded up.\u201d Moving toward her own creative flowering, Dickinson feared yielding herself up to marriage and \u201cthe man of noon,\u201d just as she feared giving herself up to the power of God.

VThe first of these curious choices of language is \u201cdivine Majority,\u201d in line 3. \u201cThe Soul\u201d of line 1, not merely \u201ca soul\u201d or a person, shuts her door not only to people at large but also to the majority, even those who bear the stamp of divine sanction. Read this way, the poem also indicates the poet\u2019s decision not to join the society of the Elect, this even though \u201can emperor be kneeling\u201d on her doormat. The conduit of grace, an analogy favored in the sermons of Jonathan Edwards, becomes \u201cthe Valves\u201d of the soul\u2019s discrimination.

saVThough she remains \u201cunmoved,\u201d the soul is neither nihilistic nor solipsistic. Even as the capitalized letter implies zero, the soul chooses \u201cOne\u201d then becomes deaf to all entreaties \u201cLike Stone.\u201d To insist that this necessarily indicates preference for a Unitarian rather than a Trinitarian view carries the interpretation to a theological level that the poem\u2019s language will not sustain. Nevertheless, selectivity in all matters, including religion, is something the poet clearly favours.

Read this way, which merely supplements the other possible alternatives, the poem states the preference to live in a way unlike that of most nineteenth century women, spurning the conventions of social obligation and what society expects, even though an emperor might attempt to persuade her to join the larger group.

An alternative meaning for \u201cmajority\u201d however provides a reading which is more in keeping with the poem\u2019s peremptory opening: \u201cDo not try to introduce other candidates for the soul\u2019s approval once she has come of age as a divine individual!\u201d \u201cPresent\u201d has now become imperative, the rhythm of the line much more forceful. The poet\u2019s ready resort to the ambiguities her lexicon primed her with (a habitual practice) guarantees that while we prefer this second reading we cannot entirely exclude the first, especially when we find that it anticipates the poem\u2019s final image:

V\u201cLike Stone -\u201d suggests the heroic intransigence of the individual act of choice; along with \u201cValves\u201d however it allows the subordinate recognition that petrified or fossilised valves could not be opened even if the decision (and flow of human sympathy) were reversed. In this context the repeated \u201cUnmoved\u201d in stanza two becomes less ritually portentous, taking on the same kind of ambiguity as that in poem 216 (\u201cSafe in their Alabaster Chambers\u201d) \u2013 not only \u201cresolute\u201d but also \u2018incapable of being touched by human feeling\u201d:

VIt was this poetic method that allowed the poet to give structured verbal play to the provincial anti-role without simplifying the internal conflict between the local culture which secured her status and the cosmopolitan culture which belittled it. Karl Mannheim sees as a classic and often repeated cultural situation the one in which the mythology of the dominant caste of a static rural society (doomed to decline) encounters that of a larger more mobile urban stratum: for a member of the older group, he says, \u201ctwo modes of explanation will collide in thinking about every object.\u201d This was Emily Dickinson\u2019s predicament. She escaped from the traumatic social pressures of her marginality into the creative isolation in which she could write her poetry: her practice of the latter on her own terms provided what Berger and Luckmann call a finite province of meaning, an enclave within the paramount reality\u2019 of common experience. But, as Mannheim says,

saVThe fact that we give names to things which are in flux implies inevitably a certain stabilisation created along the lines of collective activity. The derivation of our meanings emphasises and covers up, in the interest of collective action, the perpetually fluid process underlying all things.

VThe poet\u2019s withdrawal into isolation, his facility within the poetic \u201cenclave\u201d does not mean immunity from social pressures. His language, imagery, syntax have to envisage a collectivity, an audience however small, by which they can be understood. For Emily Dickinson, constructing in what so many of her poems describe as \u201csilence\u201d the fictions which gave order to her experience, there were two overlapping \u201ccollectivities,\u201d that represented by the good society of her locality and that of the genteel literary audience. Each could be summed up in the person of a representative reader. There are a number of extraordinarily alienated poems written in this period of tension which will be discussed later (Chapter 7 (iv)); and it is impossible to decide whether they are written out of damaged or renounced personal relationships, neurotic mental states or the struggle with words itself.
