V\u201cMiles Away\u201d is a song by American singer-songwriter Madonna from her eleventh studio album, Hard Candy. It was first released as a promotional single in Japan, during June 2008, as the theme for the Fuji Television Japanese drama, Change. The song was released by Warner Bros. Records, as the third and final single from the album on October 17, 2008, and was subsequently included on her compilation album, Celebration (2009). Written by Madonna, Justin Timberlake, Timbaland and Nate \u201cDanja\u201d Hills, \u201cMiles Away\u201d is a melancholy electronic ballad, which according to Madonna is autobiographical, and is inspired by her then husband Guy Ritchie. Lyrically, the song deals with long-distance relationships.
